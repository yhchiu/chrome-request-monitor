## 🛠️ Technical Specifications

- **Manifest Version**: V3

- **Required Permissions**:

## Why site access (`<all_urls>`) is required

- Real-time monitoring across sites: The extension observes request URLs on pages you visit and matches them against your custom rules. Because target sites cannot be listed in advance, access to all sites is required for reliable operation.
- Background listener scope: The background service uses `chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest` with a URL filter of `<all_urls>` and reads only what is necessary for matching: request URL, timestamp, and tab identification. It does not block or modify traffic and does not read request or response bodies.
- Content script overlay: The content script runs on pages matching `<all_urls>` only to render a small, temporary on-page overlay when a match is found. It renders UI to help you copy the URL and does not read or alter page content.
- Data minimization and control: All processing is local. Rules/settings are stored in Chrome Sync; found URLs are kept only for the current session and can be cleared anytime. Monitoring can be toggled, and results can be limited to the current tab.

## 🔒 Privacy Notice

- This extension only processes data locally and does not upload any information to external servers
- User-defined rules are stored in Chrome sync storage
- Found URLs are only temporarily stored in memory and are not permanently saved
